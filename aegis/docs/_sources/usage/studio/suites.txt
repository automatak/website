============================
Adding suites
============================

*Test Suites* are collections of test procedures. They act as folders in which you can organize your tests. |Aegis| comes with 
recommended test suites for each protocol that you can find in the *tests* subdirectory of your install, typically:

.. code-block:: console
   
   C:\Program Files (x86)\Automatak\Aegis Fuzzer\tests

When the Studio first starts up, the tree view is empty. You can load a configuration via the *File* menu or you
can define an initial test suite by clicking *New*.

You are presented with a set of configuration options that are applied to every procedure within the suite. A description of each option is available in a tooltip by hovering over the option name.

The first grouping, *channel*, allows you to configure the communication channel used for every test in the suite. You can double click on any option (marked by a gear)
to change the value. Values that are modified from their default settings are marked in **bold**. You can return any setting to its default by 
right clicking and selecting *Reset to default*.
