============================
Adding procedures
============================

*Procedures* are specific sets of test cases that can be individually configured and run. They appear in the main Studio form as a two circulating arrows 
underneath suite folder(s). You can add a procedure to a suite by right clicking on a suite node in the tree and then clicking *Add Procedure*.

You can reorder procedures within a suite by dragging and dropping the procedure nodes onto each other.

----------------------------
Generic options
----------------------------

Each test procedure has a number of generic options that can be configured in addition to any per-procedure options.

* **reopen** - Close and reopen the channel before every test. This is useful in stream-based protocols where an invalid message permanently corrupts the session.
* **start** - Start testing a particular test case id.
* **count** - Limit the number of test cases to the specified count.
* **repeats** - Repeat the specified test sequence (all settings) more than once. Useful for stressing non-fatal or non-deterministic bugs.
* **fill** - Specifics the source the "fill" value for non-random constant data.
* **constant** - The byte value to use for constant-fill mode.
* **seed** - The seed to use for the pseudo-random number generator.

*Start* and *count* are the most frequently adjusted parameters by the user. Most of the other values already have reasonable defaults
in the install-included test plans.
