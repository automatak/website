=============================
Test Plans
=============================

Your |Aegis| installation of contains recommended test plans for DNP3 outstations and masters.

* plans\\dnp3-master.xml
* plans\\dnp3-outstation.xml

In most cases, the only parameters you need to adjust will be the source and destination link layer addresses of the target, and possibly the 
host (IP) parameter if you're testing an external target. Refer to the parameters section if you need to adjust timeouts or health checking.

The recommended test plan repeats some of the procedures with different fill or random seeds. It is recommended that you follow the plan for maximum efficacy, but
on slow DNP3 implementations, this could take a long time. Some DNP3 implementations can handle hundreds of test cases per second, while others only seem to handle
a couple dozen. It may be worth figuring out why the implementation is slow to respond to health checks or requests. You might consider running additional random seeds 
besides zero if your have enough time.

The last test case in each plan generates random application layer data within appropriate encapsulation. It is arbitrarily set to 1,000,000
iterations. Run as many iterations as you can tolerate with the speed of your device.
