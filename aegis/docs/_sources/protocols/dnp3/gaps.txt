Known gaps
-----------------------------

The DNP3 fuzzer provides good coverage of the DNP3 link, transport, and application layers. Specialized test cases are provided for each layer
and some targeted test cases are provided for known failure points within layers such as transport reassembly buffer overflows.

There are some known gaps within the current version. Notably the following object groups are not explicitly modeled:

* Group 0 - Device Attributes
* Group 70 - File transfer / free-form qualifier 0x5B
* Group 80 - Datasets 
* Group 120 - Secure authentication objects

This is not to say that |Aegis| cannot find bugs related to this functionality. The *app-rand-request* and *app-rand-unsol* procedures produce pseudo-random
ASDUs with many unknown function codes and qualifiers. It is just less likely that bugs in these objects will be found because they are not yet directly modeled
in the *app-request* and *app-unsol* procedures.
