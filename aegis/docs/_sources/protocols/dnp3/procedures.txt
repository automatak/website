Procedures
=============================

* **link** - Link layer (outstation or master)
   * Fuzzes the link layer using many permutations of control octets, lengths, and special addresses.

* **transport** - Transport layer (outstation or master)
   * Fuzzes the transport layer with unexpected lengths, sequence numbers, and over-sized ASDUs.

* **app-request** - Application layer requests (outstation)
   * Fuzzes the application layer with a large number of function codes, qualifier codes, and malformed contents.
   * Explicitly sends start/stop/count values likely to cause integer overflows.

* **app-unsol** - Application layer unsolicited (master)
   * Fuzzes the application layer with a large number of unsolicited responses (master)

* **rand-app-request** - Randomized application layer requests (outstation)
   * Fuzzes the application layer with semi-random requests
   * Capable of finding some bugs in functions, qualifiers, and objects not explicitly modeled elsewhere.

* **rand-app-unsol** - Randomized application layer unsolicited responses (master)
   * Fuzzes the application layer with semi-random unsolicited responses
   * Capable of finding some bugs in qualifiers and objects not explicitly modeled elsewhere.

* **app-octet-unsol** - Unsolicited 0-length octet strings (groups 110-113) (master)
   * Tests for a specific, but common, bug in the handling of Group 110-113 variation 0

* **app-octet-write** - Unsolicited 0-length octet strings (groups 110-113) (outstation)
   * Similar to *app-octet-unsol*, but performs a WRITE of a large numbers of 0-length octet string headers
