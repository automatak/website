=============================
Health checks
=============================

DNP3 tests optionally use a feature of the link layer to identify if a target has failed. After every attack frame, the fuzzer sends a link layer request
and expects a response.

The fuzzer no longer validates the response, it just expects some valid link layer frame to indicate the target is still alive. You can configure two types of health
checks:

* LINK_STATUS (default)
* RESET_LINK_STATES

Most implementations will work well with the defaults. Some non-conformant implementations may require the alternative health type.
