============================
DNP3
============================

DNP3 is a complex SCADA protocol with 3 layers.

* link
* transport
* application

The link and transport layers for DNP3 are identical for the client (master) and server (outstation). The same test cases
can be applied to both at these layers.

The application layer contains a myriad of object types defined by a *group* and *variation*. The semantic meaning of these objects depends on
the *function code* (e.g. READ, WRITE, OPERATE) and the receiver (client/server).

DNP3 has an *unsolicited* reporting mode whereby the outstation initiates communications. This is very useful for testing the master response parsing
without having to wait for requests.
