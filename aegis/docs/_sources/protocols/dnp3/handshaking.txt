=============================
Handshaking
=============================

The fuzzer can perform some automatic handshaking in response to certain messages. This keeps the target happy, particularly during the master startup sequence.

* UNCONFIRMED_USER_DATA - The fuzzer parses the application layer header and if the frame is any function code other than RESPONSE or UNSOLICITED_RESPONSE it responds with a NULL application response with the same sequence number.

* CONFIRMED_USER_DATA - The fuzzer first responses with a link layer ACK and then handles the message the same as UNCONFIRMED.

* RESET_LINK_STATES - The fuzzer responses with an ACK.

* REQUEST_LINK_STATES - The fuzzer responses with a LINK_STATUS.
