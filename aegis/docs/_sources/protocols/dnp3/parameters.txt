=============================

A number of DNP3 specific parameters are available at the module level.

* **src** -  Source address

The link-layer source address. This is address of the fuzzer itself.

The link-layer source address. This is address of the fuzzer itself, i.e. who you are pretending to be.

* **master** - Link-layer master bit

This setting configures the link layer 'master' bit for fuzzing masters. By default, this setting is configured for fuzzing
outstations. This setting must be applied when fuzzing master stations.

* **retries** - Number of health-check retries

The number of attempts the fuzzer will make to query the target with a health check before deciding it has failed.

* **timeout** - Health-check timeout

The timeout (in milliseconds) for reading a link layer frame from the target during a health-check.

* **healthType** - Health-check type

Enumeration [LinkStatus, ResetLink, None] that defines what kind of health check to use.

* **healthMode** - Determines when the health check occurs

Enumeration [Before, After] that determines when the health check occurs relative to the test frame.
