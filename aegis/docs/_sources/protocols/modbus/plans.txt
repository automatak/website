=============================
Test Plans
=============================

Your |Aegis| installation of contains recommended test plans for Modbus slaves and masters.

* plans\\modbus-master.xml
* plans\\modbus-slave.xml

In most cases, the only parameters you need to adjust will be the *unitid* of the target when testing slaves, and possibly the 
host (IP) parameter if you're testing an external target. Refer to the parameters section if you need to adjust timeouts or health checking.

The recommended test plan repeats some of the procedures with different fill or random seeds.

You should repeat the full master test plan with a high-frequency request for each function code that you can configure to do so. For instance, you might have
four master configurations that respectively scan:

* Read coils (0x01)
* Read discrete inputs (0x02)
* Read holding registers (0x03)
* Read input registers (0x04)

If you can configure your software to send control requests, run the suite against those function codes as well.
