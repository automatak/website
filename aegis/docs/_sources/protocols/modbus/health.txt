=============================
Health checks
=============================

The Modbus slave tests optionally use a simple READ_COILS request as a health check. This check can be disabled.

Modbus clients do not send a health check message, as there is no request you can send to a client to stimulate a response. Instead, the fuzzer waits for the next
request as a health check, and then sends the next test frame with the same transaction id as the request.
