Modbus TCP
============================

Vanilla Modbus TCP is a simple protocol that utilizes a basic request-response design. The specification is available from `Modbus.org <http://www.modbus.org/>`_ 
at no charge.

The protocol transports application layer messages uses a simple envelope called the MBAP. The application layer itself supports function codes that completely
determine the shape of the contents.

Modbus servers are easy to fuzz test. You can simply iterate through the various function code models. Modbus clients are more challenging, because any decent
implementation will only parse response data that appears to be from the request. In other words, you will usually only be testing the parser for that particular
request. This is very different to a DNP3 that has function  + object semantics that allow for a nearly infinite number of permutations. To thoroughly test a Modbus
client, the tester must iteratively reconfigure and test every possible function code that can be sent from the master.
