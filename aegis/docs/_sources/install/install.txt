============================
Installation
============================

|Aegis| is distributed as a windows MSI installer. The requirements for installation are as follows:

* Windows Vista, 7, 8, or 10
* .NET runtime 4.0 or greater (not installed by installer) 
* 512 MB RAM
* |Aegis| will not install or run in a virtual machine

By default, the installer will choose a directory like the following for the installation path.

.. code-block:: bash
   
   C:\Program Files (x86)\Automatak\Aegis Fuzzer

The executables are installed in the *bin* sub-directory of this folder. After a successful installation you should be able to 
run the AegisStudio link created in your start menu's program files *All Programs >> Automatak >> Aegis Fuzzer >> AegisStudio*.

If you have never installed a license, or your license is no longer invalid, you should see the licensing splash screen:

----------------------------
Licensing
----------------------------

Aegis is distributed and licensed under a subscription model. Per-seat licenses are bound to particular machines via a combination
of hardware attributes. To license your Aegis installation, follow these steps:

1) Install |Aegis| and run AegisStudio
2) When the license splash screen appears, generate a hardware ID file (hid) and save it somewhere.
3) Email the hardware ID to **licensing@automatak.com** along with your customer info.
4) Place the license file in the reply in the **bin** sub-directory of your |Aegis| installation.

Your |Aegis| installation will now work for the term of your subscription. You will receive a warning 2 weeks prior to the expiration
of your subscription to get a new license file.

Note: Both the Studio and the Console runners use the same licensing mechanism.
